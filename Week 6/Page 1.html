        <h2>Little Story</h2>

        <p>
		    I recently went backpacking with my friends. When we got to our campsite, however, we were bombarded by endless hoardes of goats. <br>
            Apparantly, campers have gotten in a bad habbit of feeding all of the goats and so the goats are a little too comfortable with people. <br>
            In fact, they were so comfortable with people that they wouldn't even run away from us when we tried to yell them away. <br>
            What we had to end up doing was tying a plastic bag to a stick and violently shake it while charging at them! <br>
